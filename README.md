## 🔬 About Me

I'm a reverse engineer and security researcher specializing in **anti-tamper development** and **exploit research** across multiple architectures. With expertise in x86/ARM instruction sets and low-level system internals, I develop security solutions and analyze complex binaries. Currently pursuing a **Software/Computer Engineer degree** at University West while collaborating on security projects and custom tools.

**Open to:** Anti-tamper consulting • Security research collaboration • Exploit development partnerships
